Buffer fix

- remove RP900 & RP901
- U603 & U604, solder pullup:
  pin 1 network to pin 10 IC
  pin 1-9 (or 2-9) network at pin 1-9 (or 2-9) IC
- res pullup RP903 & RP908 (3.3kohm)
  replace 1kohm or connect pin 36 of U800 to +5V via 1kohm
- solder resistor betweenm pins 11 and 20 of U605



Other infos:
- Resistor arrays RP900 and RP901 located on either side of U100 Resistor arrays 9 * 3.3KOhm from pins 1-9 to pin 10 of U603 and U604 attached
- Pullup resistor 1 kohm between address strobe (pin 36 of U800, buster) and + 5V (only needed if the 74ALS245 from Signetics) Pinch left side of R215 and solder to left side of C215
x E-Clock terminated (series connection of 68ohms and 270pF soldered to the rightmost of the 4 vias below CN303 and ground) 




Rev. 6.2
    modification
        Complete Buffer Fix completely
        Better video picture
        Remove left connector from R215 and solder to left side of C215
        Solves Molly problem
        x Solder 68 ohms and 270 pF series to the far right of the 4 vias below CN303, ground the other end of the circuit
        Eliminates switching guru
        x Install voltage monitor (PST518B, Mitsumi) instead of D802. Pin 1 at cathode D802, pin 2 at ground, pin 3 at anode D802
        Eliminates turbo cards shutdown problem
        Remove capacitor C909 

Rev. 6.3 (installing Kickstart 2.03 and Denise 8373)
Rev. 6.4 (replace old Agnus with 8375, instead of resistor R101: Capacitor (100nF) from right side of R101 to ground)
